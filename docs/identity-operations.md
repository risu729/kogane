# Identity projection operations

The existing private `kogane-observation-pipeline` runs identity projection
after parsing on its five-minute schedule. It has no public route. The browser
remains GET/HEAD-only behind the existing Access gate.

## Bounded catchup

From `services/observation-pipeline` in the authenticated WSL environment:

```sh
node scripts/identity-ops.ts catchup 500 sbi-securities
node scripts/identity-ops.ts catchup 1000
```

The first command is the SBI-first rollout; the second covers all existing
successful parses, including superseded history. Each service invocation has a
200-new-observation budget and up to 40 candidate parses. Pages checkpoint in
the immutable staging rows; an interrupted or budget-limited run skips completed
rows on its next invocation. Only a complete run is sealed/visible. Empty
successful parses can be sealed; failed or unsealed-A parses cannot.

`processedRuns` measures touched jobs, `identifiedRuns` newly completed jobs,
and `identifiedObservations` newly staged rows. The script stops only when there
are no candidate runs, not merely when a large partial job has no seal yet.
It prints counters only. The maximum sweep argument is a safety bound, not
proof of completion; verify remaining coverage afterward.

## Corrections

Inspect the protected account/instrument list for the reference ID, existing
target ID, current revision and provenance. Put a deliberately reviewed change
in a **local, uncommitted** JSON file:

```json
{
  "kind": "account",
  "referenceId": "source-reference-from-protected-ui",
  "targetId": "existing-target-from-protected-ui",
  "expectedRevision": 1,
  "reason": "Evidence supporting this explicit correction"
}
```

Then run `node scripts/identity-ops.ts revise /absolute/path/to/change.json`.
Instrument corrections use `kind: "instrument"`. Neither operation edits raw
evidence, observations, quantities, or financial classifications. A stale
revision fails, rather than replacing another operator's decision. Target
metadata is taken from its current mapping claims (or initial entity metadata
if it has no mapping), never silently from an obsolete claim. Ambiguous target
metadata is rejected. Manual mappings are not overwritten by scheduled rules.

## Verification and rollback

- `/api/identity/coverage` compares all eligible current B observations against
  completed C runs by source; organized is not globally identified.
- `/api/identity/accounts` and `/api/identity/instruments` read effective mapping
  revisions, expose their evidence links, and paginate at 100 rows.
- Preserve the original pinned decision IDs to audit what was recorded at the
  time, even after a manual correction.
- Old B parses/failed acquisitions remain in their own history and never
  become current merely because an identity run was sealed.
- Roll back code/scheduling if necessary; do not delete the append-only C tables
  or roll back unrelated ongoing collector ingestion.

Vpass ordinal references deliberately remain run-scoped until a verified
durable-card sidecar is available. Product names and rotating selection tokens
alone do not authorize a permanent card mapping. That migration is a separate
change, not an assumption hidden in the initial projection.
